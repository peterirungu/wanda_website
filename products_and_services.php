                    <h3>Soil Fertility</h3>
                </div>
	    		<p>
	    			Kenyan farmland soils are badly depleted. Under continuous farming, the land is not allowed to rejuvenate.The problem is worsened by nutrient mining without replenishing soil nutrients. The farmersâ€™ challenge is either to produce more food and more income from less and less land with rapidly deteriorating soils, or to turn drylands into productive farms. So, the right technologies must include those which can restore and improve soil health and fertility.

                </div>
	    		<p>
	    			Getting your crop nutrition spot on is essential for maximising yields. Too little nutrition will reduce the crops' yield potential, while too much fertiliser can impact production and profitability. So, careful monitoring and management of nutrient levels is important to ensure yield potential is reached, without inefficient fertiliser application.
